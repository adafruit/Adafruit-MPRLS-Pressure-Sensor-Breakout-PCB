### Description

We stock a few barometric pressure sensors, great for altitude and weather measurements. This pressure sensor is special because it comes with a metal port! Unlike other pressure sensors, you can easily attach a tube to it, to measure air pressure inside a close space. In particular we think this would be a great sensor for use with making DIY assistive tech "Sip & Puff" interfaces, or measuring the pressure within a vacuum chamber or other pressurized container.

Unlike most ported pressure sensors, this one uses I2C, it's really easy to use with any microcontroller. Inside is a silicone-gel covered pressure sensing gauge with a pre-calibrated and compensated 24 bit ADC. We have [example code and libraries for Arduino](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPRLS) or [CircuitPython/Python](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MPRLS). You can measure absolute pressure 0 to 25 PSI, which is a great range since ambient pressure here on Earth is about 14.5 PSI.

The port is made of stainless steel and is 3.7mm long and 2.5mm diameter. It doesn't come with tubing so be sure to purchase some tubing to attach to the port.

We've placed this nice sensor on a breakout board with 3.3V power regulation and level shifting so you can use it with any kind of microcontroller or microcomputer, from an Arduino compatible to Raspberry Pi
